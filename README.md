## üîß Configuration

### Environment Modes

The system supports multiple operational modes through the `config.json` settings:

```json
{
  "PROJECT_SETTINGS": {
    "isLocal": true,    // Local blockchain or mainnet
    "isDeployed": true  // Execute trades or simulate only
  }
}
```

#### Mode Combinations

| isLocal | isDeployed | Description                             |
|---------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| true    | true       | Local testing with trade execution      |
| true    | false      | Local testing with simulation only      |
| false   | true       | Mainnet monitoring with trade execution |
| false   | false      | Mainnet monitoring with simulation only |

### Testing Strategies

#### Local Development
```bash
# Set in config.json
{
  "PROJECT_SETTINGS": {
    "isLocal": true,
    "isDeployed": true
  }
}
```
Perfect for development and testing arbitrage strategies without risking real assets.

#### Mainnet Price Monitoring
```bash
# Set in config.json
{
  "PROJECT_SETTINGS": {
    "isLocal": false,
    "isDeployed": false
  }
}
```
Monitor real-time arbitrage opportunities without executing trades. Ideal for:
- Strategy validation
- Market analysis
- Performance testing
- Risk assessment

#### Production Deployment
```bash
# Set in config.json
{
  "PROJECT_SETTINGS": {
    "isLocal": false,
    "isDeployed": true
  }
}
```
Full production mode with real trade execution. Requires:
- Deployed smart contracts
- Funded accounts
- Proper security measures
- Network connectivity

## ü§ñ Bot Architecture

### Core Components

The trading bot implements a sophisticated event-driven architecture with five primary components:

#### 1. Main Event Monitor (`main()`)
- Establishes WebSocket connections to DEXes
- Monitors real-time swap events
- Manages concurrent execution states
- Initializes system components

#### 2. Price Analysis Engine (`checkPrice()`)
- Real-time price discovery across DEXes
- Calculates cross-exchange price differentials
- Implements price normalization
- Logs market conditions for analysis

#### 3. Strategy Director (`determineDirection()`)
- Determines optimal trading routes
- Analyzes market depth
- Returns executable trading paths
- Validates exchange liquidity

#### 4. Profitability Engine (`determineProfitability()`)
- Advanced profit calculation algorithms
- Gas cost optimization
- Slippage prediction
- Risk assessment metrics

#### 5. Execution Manager (`executeTrade()`)
- Smart contract interaction
- Transaction management
- Flash loan coordination
- Post-trade verification

### System Customization

#### Trading Parameters
```javascript
// Configuration constants
const UNLOCKED_ACCOUNT = '0xdEAD...'  // Test account
const AMOUNT = '40500000000000'       // Trade size
```

#### Strategy Modification
The profitability engine can be customized by modifying `determineProfitability()`:
```javascript
function determineProfitability(routerPath, token0Contract, token0, token1) {
    // Implement custom trading strategy
    // Return true if profitable opportunity exists
}
```

#### Testing Framework
- `manipulate.js`: Price impact simulation
- `bot.js`: Strategy testing
- Configurable test parameters
- Detailed execution logs
